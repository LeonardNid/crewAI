## Task: Based on the content strategy for each Instagram post, create the the visual art that will be published on Instagram on each day of the week. To do that, you will need to create a detailed description of the image that you will use for each day.  The descriptions that you will use need to be detailed, yet concise, and should include the main elements that should be present in the image. Describe the colors, the objects, the mood, and any other relevant information that you think is important for the image to be created.
Here are some examples of the descriptions that you could use: - A realistic image of a living room with a modern design. The room should have a large window with a view of a cityscape. The color palette should be neutral, with a pop of color in the form of a red sofa. The room should be well-lit, with a cozy and inviting atmosphere. - A minimalist image of a desk with a laptop, a notebook, and a cup of coffee. The desk should be made of light wood, and the background should be a plain white wall. The image should convey a sense of focus and productivity. - A vibrant image of a tropical beach at sunset. The beach should be deserted, with palm trees swaying in the wind. The sky should be a mix of warm colors, with the sun setting on the horizon. The image should evoke a sense of relaxation and tranquility.
