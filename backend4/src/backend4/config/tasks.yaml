    current Task: create a Output/models.py file with the following instructions:
    1) Use the "FileReaderTool" tool exactly once to read the "templates/models_template.py" file 
      Then strictly follow that template's structure, 
      only filling in the designated placeholders (examples) with your actual model definitions.
    2) Define Models as per the requirement of the customer.
      Add primary key to each model.
      Each Model should have all the fields as per the requirement of the customer
      and have a "to_dict" Method.
  expected_output: >
    Your Final answer must be the full Output/model.py file, only the python code and nothing else.
    The code must not be in any quotes e.g. """<code>""".

    current Task: create an Output/app.py file with the  following instructions:
    1) Use the "FileReaderTool" tool exactly once to read the "templates/app_template.py" file
      Then strictly follow that template's structure, 
      only filling in the designated placeholders with your code (example).
      You may add new routes, but do not alter the overall layout.
      You may add new model imports as needed.
    2) Define the endpoints as per the requirement of the customer.
      The resulting "Output/app.py" must:
      - import the models from the models.py file.
      - have every route as per the requirement of the customer.
      - be fully operational and error free.
    More Information:
      - Never define your own Models, import and use the models from the context you got
