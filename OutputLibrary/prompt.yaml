    I want to manage a small public library.
    Books have a title, author, ISBN, genre, publication year and a flag whether they are currently borrowed.
    Members have a name, e-mail address, membership number, and a date when their membership expires.
    Each loan should track the book, the member, a checkout date and a due date.
    I'd like endpoints to:
      - add / edit / delete books and members
      - borrow and return a book
      - list overdue loans
      - search books by title or author
