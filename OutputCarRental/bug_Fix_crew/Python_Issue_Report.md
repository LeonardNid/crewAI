| 1   | models.py, Location model       | All endpoints using Location or related    | Multiple foreign key paths from Rental to Location cause ambiguity for relationship Location.rentals. Location.rentals relationship is referenced but not defined with explicit foreign_keys, causing SQLAlchemy mapper failure. | Add an explicit 'rentals' relationship in Location that includes both pickup and dropoff rentals, specifying foreign_keys and primaryjoin using SQLAlchemy's or_ to combine the two foreign keys. For example: `rentals = relationship("Rental", primaryjoin="or_(Location.id==Rental.pickup_location_id, Location.id==Rental.dropoff_location_id)", foreign_keys=[Rental.pickup_location_id, Rental.dropoff_location_id], lazy=True)` or remove all usage of Location.rentals if not needed. |
| 2   | models.py, Rental model         | All endpoints with rentals                  | Rental has two foreign keys to Location (pickup_location_id and dropoff_location_id). Location currently defines two relationships with foreign_keys specified correctly, but any presence of a backref named 'rentals' without foreign_keys causes ambiguity. | Confirm no backrefs or relationships named 'rentals' in Rental or Location exist without explicit foreign_keys. If such backrefs exist (e.g., backref='rentals'), remove them or replace with explicit relationships. This prevents ambiguity in join condition resolution by SQLAlchemy.                                                                                                       |
| 3   | models.py, Location model       | Any code or tests accessing Location.rentals | Location lacks a 'rentals' relationship but error references it, causing failure.                                                                                                                                                | Define 'rentals' relationship explicitly in Location as an aggregate of both pickup and dropoff rentals to resolve ambiguity and prevent mapper initialization failure. This gives a unified access point to all rentals of a Location and clarifies join paths for SQLAlchemy.                                                                                                       |
