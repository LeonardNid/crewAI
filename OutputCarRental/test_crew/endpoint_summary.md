Notes on deletion order and dependencies:
- Service depends on Car (many-to-one), so DELETE /services should come before DELETE /cars.
- Payment depends on Rental (many-to-one), so DELETE /payments should come before DELETE /rentals, but no DELETE route for payments is defined.
- Rental depends on Car, Customer, Location (many-to-one), so DELETE /rentals before DELETE /customers, DELETE /locations, and DELETE /cars.
- Customer depends on Rental (one-to-many with cascade delete), so DELETE /customers last after rentals.
- Location depends on Car and Rental (one-to-many with cascade delete), so DELETE /locations last.
- Car depends on Location (many-to-one), and has Rentals and Services, so DELETE Services first, then Rentals, then Cars.
Given only DELETE routes for services (/services/<id>), rentals (/rentals/<id>), cars (/cars_plate_no/<plate_no>), customers (/customers/<id>), and locations (/locations/<id>), the above ordering is respected:
DELETE services -> DELETE rentals -> DELETE cars -> DELETE customers -> DELETE locations.

However, there is no DELETE /payments route given, so payment deletion is out of scope.

This completes the ordered list with all rules observed.
