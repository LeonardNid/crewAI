  topic: Bicycle Workshop
  customer: |
    I want to store the inventory of my bicycle workshop with the various parts and their compatibility.
    There are many different parts: 
    Frames: Measurements, brand, material, maximum tire width, compatible brakes, compatible bicycle gears, type of compatible drivetrain (hub, chain), 
    type of frame (gravel, road bike, touring bike, city bike, etc.), each frame type also has specific properties (for example, gravel frames might have 
    mounting points for attaching bags, road bike frames might have aerodynamic optimization, etc.), price, name (to uniquely identify the frame), weight, 
    geometry, compatible handlebars, how much weight the frame can carry, compatible seatposts, type of cable routing (external, internal).
    Rims: Tire width, compatible tire types (tubeless, with tube, etc.), rim height, weight, price, required valve length, material, compatible frames, brand.
    Brakes (sometimes brakes and bicycle gears come as one inseparable unit, e.g. on road and gravel bikes): Type (hydraulic, mechanical), compatible frames, 
    weight, price, brand, compatible bicycle gears.
    Bicycle gears (sometimes brakes and bicycle gears come as one inseparable unit, e.g. on road and gravel bikes): Type (electronic, mechanical), compatible 
    frames, weight, price, brand, compatible brakes.
    Handlebars: Type (flat, road, gravel, mountain bike), material, weight, brand, compatible frames, compatible brakes, compatible bicycle gears, price.
    Saddles: Type (padding, etc.), shape, compatible seatposts, brand, price, weight.
    Seatposts: Material, compatible frames, compatible seatposts, brand, price, weight.
    Brake pads: Brake type, compatible Brakes, brand, Price.
    And overall, I want, for example, to be able to select a frame and then see the possible choices of compatible components. You should also be able 
    to specify exactly which components should be listed if, for instance, only one part is broken. But in theory, it would also be nice if you could configure 
    a whole bike, so you can see what fits together.

    The movies should be labelled with the main actor(s), the

    with the exact weight I used. Moreover I want a         
    Field, that shows the increase (or decrease in %) of weight and increase 
    (or decrease in %) of reps with all exercises  
    mentioned to when they were mentioned first.
